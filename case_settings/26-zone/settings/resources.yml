# DATA YEAR
# Pick one or more years of generator data to use when creating clusters. If
# more than one year is used then things like heat rate will be calculated as the
# average (weighted by generation per year).

# CAPACITY TYPE

# CLUSTERING
# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions
# that are different.

# The atb_modifers parameter is now used to add a VOM cost to battery technologies. PNNL

# Var_OM_Cost_per_MWh_In (https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-28866.pdf).
# Because Var_OM_Cost_per_MWh_In is not part of the ATB database the value should be set
# directly rather than using a list of [operator, value]. Operators ("add", "mul",
# "truediv", and "sub") can only be used to modify values that exist in the ATB database.
