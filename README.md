# MIP_results_comparison
Automatically create comparison figures for MIP runs. Upload a folder with your results summary files to the appropriate top-level folder (e.g. `3z-debug-scenarios`) and a GitHub Action will create comparison figures.

## Dashboard results

The results are now being compiled as dashboards and can be accessed at https://gschivley.github.io/MIP_results_comparison.
